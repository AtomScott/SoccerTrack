# Data 

This repo contains snippets of very small video/image data that can be used to demo the tracking functions of SoccerTrack.

The videos are encoded with h.265 and are short enough so that they can live on github (https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/38380). Unfortunately it doesn't seem like they can be previewed on the web so download it and view it locally with something like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/).

## Contents Overview

In order to keep the size of the repo small, only a few compressed raw files are uploaded on github. Below is an overview of the directory structure before running tracking.
